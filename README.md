# DistributedProgrammingSeriesSum

This assignment deals with parallel programming using the message passing model. In this assignment
you will construct parallel solutions to certain problems and implement them using the Message Passing
Interface: MPI in either C or C++.

An integer N denoting the number of terms in the series that your program has to use.For N = 4, series
would be 1/(12) + 1/(22) + 1/(32) + 1(42).
